#' Action Word List
#'
#' A dataset containing a vector of action words.  This is a subset of the
#' Moby project: Moby Part-of-Speech.
#'
#' @details
#' From Grady Ward's Moby project:
#' "This second edition is a particularly thorough revision of the original Moby
#' Part-of-Speech. Beyond the fifteen thousand new entries, many thousand more
#' entries have been scrutinized for correctness and modernity. This is
#' unquestionably the largest P-O-S list in the world. Note that the many included
#' phrases means that parsing algorithms can now tokenize in units larger than a
#' single word, increasing both speed and accuracy."  Originally downloaded
